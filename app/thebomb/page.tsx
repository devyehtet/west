        <p className="mb-6">The idea</p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          While visiting the exhibition “When we see the planes” in Bangkok in
          June 2024, feelings of horror and helplessness once again evoked.
          Seeing the artwork and installation of a typical bamboo hut, the
          images of people in makeshift underground bunkers as well as smoke
          columns after air strikes...the sheer madness and monstrosity of
          dropping state-of-the-art cluster and vacuum bombs from fighter planes
          onto small, remote bamboo hut villages!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          But there is always one thing missing which is hardly ever seen, the
          thing that actually causes all this killing, destruction and
          suffering, the bomb itself. So abstract, so hidden and vanished after
          impact. How big are these bombs actually and how do they look?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          To fight my feelings of helplessness, I talked to the curator of the
          exhibition (Hnin) and we developed the idea to create a replica of a
          bomb, in addition to the exhibition which would show in Chiang Mai
          later again, to give visitors an impression of a real bomb which was
          actually used in a Myanmar airstrike.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The use of such weapons against other people is generally unimaginable
          and yet takes place every day in various areas of the world. Ukraine,
          Gaza and Lebanon are currently the more prominent ones but there have
          been 34034 airstrikes in Myanmar since the coup and until December
          2024. While there is comparably little footage from Myanmar, in video
          recordings from Gaza and Lebanon you can even watch bombs while they
          are approaching until the impact. It is beyond our comprehension what
          is actually going on in such moments, except or maybe even
          particularly for the ones who experienced themselves, as the victim
          does not see the bomb coming, only the plane.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The technical apparatus behind what is actually happening, is well
          hidden. The public, whose tax money is used to purchase these weapons,
          is sealed off and usually never sees them or the quantities in which
          they are produced. Manufactured, sold, transported and stored in
          seclusion and under government protection, touched or even seen by
          only a very limited amount of people. The bombs for the airstrikes are
          at some point attached to a military aircraft and dropped on
          human-defined targets. Even the final decision makers probably do not
          actually see the exact bomb being dropped on a specific target, it is
          all part of a killing machine. The Junta in Myanmar purchases weapons
          and military equipment from various countries. After most air strikes,
          it remains unclear which bomb exactly has been used. The manufacturer,
          model and other details usually cannot be verified since the remnants
          are too small and abstract. After some air raids, however, there are
          remains that allow a clear identification. This happened after the
          junta’s deadliest air strike to date since the 2021 coup on Pazigyi on
          April 11th, 2023, with around 170 dead.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The remains could be traced back to a Russian KAB-500 which had been
          sold to Myanmar several times over the past decades. KAB stands for
          Korrektiruyeskaya Aviatsionnaya Bomba, i.e. a correctable air bomb in
          contrast to unguided or so-called “dumb” bombs. The onboard daylight
          electro-optical TV seeker under and a scene-matching area correlation
          guidance system under the glass sphere enable the bomb to locate and
          lock onto a specific target visually. Once the bomb is released from
          the plane, it operates autonomously without further control by the
          pilot or ground station. The KAB-500 is described as a high accuracy
          (around 4 m to the target) fire and forget bomb for high value assets.
          The KAB series consists of different models and sizes based on the
          American GBUs (Guided Bomb Unit) from the Vietnam War in the 1970s and
          available in bunker-busting, cluster bomb and vacuum bomb versions.
          Without own propulsion but with a range of around 17 km, it enables
          the pilot to drop from great heights and distances.

        <p className="">
          The KAB-500 weighs approximately 525 kg with a length of 305 cm and a
          diameter of 38 cm, 75 cm including the wings. Since no technical plans
          could be found, the replica is rather an interpretation based on these
          basic measurements and photos from the internet. Cynically, there is a
          miniature KAB-500 children’s toy available on Amazon.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          For transport and storage reasons, the replica was divided into two
          parts and safely packed in boxes. Work started in the beginning of
          July and was carried out in 3 locations in Chiang Mai. Temporarily
          trapped by the flood in October and concluded end of November in Some
          Space Gallery with the assembly and adjustment of all parts.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          The replica consists of a Styrofoam core that was cut from Styrofoam
          blocks on a metal skewer using a hot wire. After the base body was
          finished with a tapering towards the back and a rounded tip in a
          cigar-like shape, various protective layers were applied and the shape
          was wrapped in a fiberglass resin layer. Unevenness was leveled out
          with fine car body filler and sanded. The wings and most of the add-on
          parts are made of MDF (medium-density fiberboard). Since MDF is too
          soft and the delicate parts were too fragile, they were soaked in
          resin and then sanded again. The acrylic glass tip was bought online
          and cut to size, the inner part consists of a slightly smaller acrylic
          glass hemisphere which is equipped with a photo lens and technical
          equipment as well as the webcam and display.
