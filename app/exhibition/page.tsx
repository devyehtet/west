                Due to the Mese battle, a community has resettled deeper into
                the forest after being displaced by conflict, and they&apos;ve
                constructed a new home and household items entirely from bamboo.
                The ingenuity and resourcefulness of using bamboo for both
                shelter and daily necessities without nails is truly remarkable.
                It&apos;s a testament to their resilience and ability to adapt
                to their environment.

              <p>
                At the Shan-Kayah border, in the Ban Kauk refugee camp located
                in Hpruso Township, the military council dropped two 500-pound
                bombs via airstrike at around 9 PM on September 5. This resulted
                in the deaths of nine civilians, including children, and left
                many others injured. Among the nine fatalities, six were members
                of the same family: a mother and her five children.
                Additionally, six school-age children residing in the camp were
                also killed. Furthermore, a two-year-old child, the son of a CDM
                (Civil Disobedience Movement) teacher who had been teaching at
                the camp, was among the victims.

                <p className="mb-6">
                  This short experimental film combines performance art, video
                  art, and interviews to portray the feeling of pain that people
                  experience due to the brutal airstrikes back home in
                  Burma/Myanmar. Although the artists have not personally
                  experienced attacks from fighter jets, they have dreamt about
                  these horrific scenes after working with raw footage from the
                  frontlines. As such, archival audio from the ground becomes
                  the sonic landscape in this film. At its core, this artwork is
                  born out of the artistsâ desire to face their own nightmares.Â

                <p className="mb-6">
                  Visually, the artists relied upon Butoh, animism, and
                  historical material culture such as antique textiles to weave
                  between the borderlands of fear and hope. There are two main
                  beings in this work, the green ghost and the white spirit.
                  Back home, people believe that when a person dies from
                  unnatural and violent deaths, their spirits get trapped in our
                  world, lingering as vengeful green ghosts. Building upon this
                  traditional belief, greenness becomes omnipresent in this
                  film, inviting the viewers to be haunted. The white spirit
                  represents the next generation. Even those who are yet to
                  enter this world are terrified of the airstrikes. The young
                  artist expresses this sense of foreboding fear through the
                  contemporary Japanese dance, Butoh. The mask shields the
                  identity of the young artist.Â

                  Bangladesh. In the 1990s, the Myanmar Military (or Tatmadaw)
                  encountered the Mru tribes during their clearance operation
                  against the Rohingya people. Being minorities among
                  minorities, the Mru people experienced the worst oppression
                  from the military government. Their traditional textiles were
                  banned and burned because the soldiers deemed their fashion
                  too revealing and primitive. The few that remain found their
                  way to the filmmaker and into this film.

                Mro (or Mru) are considered the most primal peoples who settled
                in the valleys of Chin Hills. Their textiles have the most
                unusual patterns and only cover parts of their body. During the
                migration of Tibeto-Burmans into the region, the Khumi-Khami-Mro
                peoples ended up in the coastal rainforests near Bay of Bengal.
                Over the past five centuries, the Khumi people began settling in
                what is now known as Southwestern parts of Chin state.
                Similarly, Khami peoples live in the Northwest Rakhine state.
                The Mro people live along the Chittagong Hills.

                AKHENS were used daily by the Mro women in the past. The

                current Khami-Khumi-Mro weavers. However, many Khami-Khumi-Mro
                weavers still know the main technique of weaving these breast
                covers, which is the supplementary single-faced weft patterning.
                This technique allows the weavers to create patterns on only one

                Si Ei village, 8th February 2024 by Kom Blai (The Roots)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The tragic event at the primary school in Daw Si Ei village,
                where a 500-pound bomb was dropped during school hours, has
                caused devastating consequences for the community. The attack
                resulted in the death of four students and injuries to 40
                others. One severely injured student required the removal of a
                kidney. This horrifying experience has deeply traumatized the
                children, leaving them fearful and withdrawn, often hiding under
                tables and being re-traumatized by loud noises. The emotional
                and psychological impact extends beyond the primary school
                students to all children in Daw Si Ei village

                  Rebuilding Lives (2024)
                </h3>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  This short life-affirming documentary weaves the stories of
                  two different refugees, Pi Ngun Hoi and Pu Tluang Cung, as
                  they rebuild their lives in the borderlands between India and
                  Burma/Myanmar. Although their journeys differ, their aim to
                  build new homes with their families unites them. In essence,
                  their stories represent the many Chin people who have been
                  displaced due to the airstrikes against Chin State in
                  Burma/Myanmar. On one side, Pi Ngun Hoi chronicles her journey
                  with pain, starting from her involvement in the Civil
                  Disobedience Movement (CDM), continuing to her near-death
                  experience during an airstrike against Khuafo, a village north
                  of Thantlang, and ending with her family building a house for
                  themselves instead of overstaying at the town&apos;s communal
                  house. On the other side, Pu Tlaung Cung expresses his sorrow
                  in losing his elder sister and his inherited house due to the
                  airstrike against Tlanglo, his village situated close to the
                  India border. But now he is focusing on rebuilding his house
                  back in Tlanglo, because his elderly parents want to return
                  back to their village before they pass away. Tying these two
                  separate stories is the traditional song that Pu Tluang
                  Cung&apos;s father sings about wanting to return to his
                  village. At its core, we see Pi Ngun Hoi&apos;s perseverance
                  to support her family despite her wounds, and Pu Tluang
                  Cung&apos;s defiant determination to fulfil his parents&apos;
                  wish to return to home. Lastly, not only their struggle to
                  rebuild new houses connect their stories, but also their firm
                  defiance against the military junta that has destroyed their
                  lives in the first place.

              <p>
                Today in Myanmar, a group of war criminals are oppressing and
                killing citizens in order to satisfy their own greed. All
                civilian areas including schools, hospitals and religious
                buildings are brutally attacked by airstrikes everyday. Many
                people had to flee their homes. Many deaths and injuries
                occurred.Â  The four artists illustrated this painting about
                social disaster.

                  Our team created a short animated video to inform and mobilize
                  the public to participate in the Paper Plane Strike on the
                  first day of the Myanmar New Year. We aim to convey a sense of
                  urgency in stopping the ongoing airstrikes perpetrated by
                  S.A.C., and we selected an artistic style for our video that
                  allowed us to paint a vivid picture of the atrocities Myanmar
                  people are forced to go through. For instance, we used an
                  artistic approach that juxtaposes 3D cartoon characters with
                  real images that depict the horrific aftermath of airstrikes
                  to highlight the harsh realities that children in Myanmar
                  experience. We also incorporated the real sound recording of
                  the airstrikes to further accentuate the urgency to stop the
                  supply of jet fuel to the junta and ultimately stop their
                  reign of terror from above.

                  MIRACLE CRASH
                </h3>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  In a land burdened with relentless suffering, where
                  individuals bear the weight of hardships beyond their years,
                  The people fervently wish for the miraculous fall of the junta
                  as they endure their daily tribulations. They harbor a
                  profound hope for the downfall of the junta and its planes and
                  jets, which heartlessly attack innocent civilians. This
                  curtain serves as a vivid illustration of the cries, prayers,
                  and curses of the people, longing for the crash of the fighter
                  jets whenever they appear. It encapsulates a fragment of the
                  deep-seated hatred carried by all of us who are adrift in this
                  sea of suffering. This is the blanket for the family, sewn
                  from the fabric of our collective wounds.
